# fixedPoolAlloc

ðŸš§ Coming Soon
- Thread-Safe Allocations: lock-free and atomics-based synchronization for safe concurrent access.
- Hardware-Aware Pool Layout: memory pool layout optimized for cacheline alignment and reduced contention on modern CPU architectures.

A fixed-size memory allocator and message queue benchmark suite for real-time systems.
Designed to test performance-critical memory management patterns in embedded and
low-latency applications.

## Module Breakdown
### fixAlloc.h
- Fixed-size memory allocator with a bitmap metadata pool.
- O(1) allocation and deallocation.
- No dynamic allocation, thread-safe behavior not guaranteed.
### msgQueueFixAlloc.h
- Lock-free circular queue using fixed allocator.
- Suitable for real-time systems where malloc is forbidden.
### msgQueueStd.h
- Identical API but uses heap (new/delete).
- For baseline performance comparison only.
### sim_benchmark.cpp
- Measures enqueue/dequeue throughput under high volume.
- Times both allocators for fair comparison.
## Test Coverage
### Allocator Tests
- Exhaustive allocation and reuse.
fixedPoolAlloc README
- Double frees.
- Invalid or misaligned frees.
- Memory integrity after reuse.
- Index-free pointer-based validation.
### Message Queue Tests
- FIFO order preservation.
- Full/empty detection.
- Stress enqueue/dequeue loops.
